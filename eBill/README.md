2.	Publishes `BILL-EXTRACTED` event to the event store based on data received from CC&B

## Bill Stager

Procedures:
1.	Gets customer information (Account ID, email) from **Subscription Service**
2.	Retrieves bill information of subscribed customers from CC&B through **Bill Retriever**
3.	Projects the bill information then saves to persistence store
4.	Publishes `BILL-STAGED` event to the event store


## Bill Retriever

This is the one responsible for fetching the extracted bills from CC&B for the consumption of **Bill Stager**.

Procedures:

## Bill Transporter

This is the one responsible for transporting the staged bills to the 3rd party client over the internet by posting to the clientâ€™s API.
