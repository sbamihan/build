# eBill 2.0

This `eBill 2.0` is **Aboitiz Power**'s pilot project for implementing [Microservices Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) using [Event Sourcing Pattern](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html).

Here is how it looks in a high level.

## eBill API

This is the main interface which serves as the entry point for all interactions from the client. External clients (like **Yondu**) and internal clients like (**CC&B**) can interact with this API thru **REST**.

Procedures:
1.	Receives data from CC&B through eBill API.

    CC&B should be able to POST data through eBill API at `/events` endpoint containing a payload like this. 

    ```json
    {
        "duCode": "dlpc",
        "batchNo": 3107
    }
    ```

    [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49769273/call-restful-api-through-oracle-query) for calling restful API through oracle query.

2.	Publishes `BILL-EXTRACTED` event to the event store based on data received from CC&B.

    Event data published in the event store should contain the original data posted from CC&B plus UUID and datetime it was created. The data should be similar to this.

    ```json
    {
        "uuid": "65a2b726-1441-498e-84ca-58e0e1c80631",
        "duCode": "dlpc",
        "batchNo": 3107,
        "creDttm": "2020-10-05T05:46:14.144+00:00"
    }
    ```

## Bill Stager

This is the one responsible for preparing and finalizing the bill information of customers who signed up for eBill Service that are included in the extracted bills.

Procedures:
1.  Bill Stager reacts to `BILL-EXTRACTED` event.
2.	Gets customer information (Account ID, email) from **Subscription Service**.
3.	Retrieves bill information of subscribed customers from CC&B through **Bill Retriever**.
    
    Should call **Bill Retriever** at endpoint GET `/findByBatchNoAndAcctNo?batchNo={{batchNo}}&acctNo={{acctNo}}`, where **batchNo** is a value from `BILL-EXTRACTED` event data and **acctNo** is a value from **Subscription Service**.

4.	Projects the bill information then saves to persistence store.
5.	Publishes `BILL-STAGED` event to the event store.

    `BILL-STAGED` event data should be similar to this.

    ```json
    {
        "uuid": "abc085d9-23ca-4183-8d08-86103fcd7532",
        "batchNo": 3107,
        "duCode": "dlpc",
        "creDttm": "2020-10-05T10:43:42.306+00:00",
        "count": 15
    }
    ```


## Bill Retriever

This is the one responsible for fetching the extracted bills from CC&B for the consumption of **Bill Stager**.

Procedures:
1.	Fetches extracted bills from CC&B based on parameters provided by **Bill Stager**.


## Bill Transporter

This is the one responsible for transporting the staged bills to the 3rd party client over the internet by posting to the clientâ€™s API.

Procedures:
1.	Reacts to `BILL-STAGED` event published in the event store.
2.	Gets bill information from persistence store based on data published on `BILL-STAGED` topic from the event store.
3.	Sends fetched bill information to 3rd party client.


## Subscription Service

This could be under the **Customer Service** domain. This is the one that manages the customer subscriptions. This is also where **Bill Stager** gets list of customers who signed up for eBill Service.
