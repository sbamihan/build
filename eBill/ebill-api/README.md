# eBill API

This is the main interface which serves as the entry point for all interactions from the client. External clients (like **Yondu**) and internal clients like (**CC&B**) can interact with this API thru **REST**.

Procedures:
1.	Receives data from CC&B through eBill API.

    CC&B should be able to POST data through eBill API at `/events` endpoint containing a payload like this. 

    ```json
    {
        "duCode": "dlpc",
        "batchNo": 3107
    }
    ```

    [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49769273/call-restful-api-through-oracle-query) for calling restful API through oracle query.

2.	Publishes `BILL-EXTRACTED` event to the event store based on data received from CC&B.

    Event data published in the event store should contain the original data posted from CC&B plus **UUID** and datetime it was created. The data should be similar to this.

    ```json
    {
        "uuid": "65a2b726-1441-498e-84ca-58e0e1c80631",
        "duCode": "dlpc",
        "batchNo": 3107,
        "creDttm": "2020-10-05T05:46:14.144+00:00"
    }
    ```
